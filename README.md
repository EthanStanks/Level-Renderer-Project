# Level-Renderer-Project
My dev 4 graphics renderer project


LowPoly Models by @Quaternius

Main Project Goal:
Select an API of your choice* and write a Level_Renderer C++ class. This class should be able to (at minimum) parse a custom text file (the level) to load and display multiple 3D models in different locations as described by the text file.

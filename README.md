# Level-Renderer-Project
My Dev4 graphics renderer project created in Vulkan with an Object Oriented approach to Data Driven Rendering.

Only renders in debug mode :(

LowPoly Models by @Quaternius

Main Project Goal:
Select an API of your choice* and write a Level_Renderer C++ class. This class should be able to (at minimum) parse a custom text file (the level) to load and display multiple 3D models in different locations as described by the text file.
You are required to use Gateware as the base code for this assignment in some capacity.

Controls:
(W): Forwards
(S): Backwards
(A): Left
(D): Right
(Space): Up
(Left_Shift): Down
(Mouse): Tilts up and down / Turns left and right
(R): Speeds Up Camera Speed
(F1): Load saved levels

How to load a level:
- Press F1
- Select a Level.txt file from the SavedLevels folder
